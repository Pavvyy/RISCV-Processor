# RISCV-Processor
This repository contains a modular implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor, developed using Verilog HDL. The processor is designed to execute a subset of RISC-V instructions in a single clock cycle. This is a work-in-progress project, with individual modules being implemented and tested incrementally.

# Features (Planned / Partially Implemented)
- RISC-V RV32I Instruction Support (subset)
- Single-cycle datapath
- Fixed-width instruction fetch from memory
- Immediate generation and ALU operations
- Register file and control logic integration
- Data memory interface
- Branch logic support
- More complete testbench and simulation

# Note
- The processor does not yet support pipeline stages or full hazard detection.
- This is a learning-focused project aimed at understanding computer architecture and digital design.
